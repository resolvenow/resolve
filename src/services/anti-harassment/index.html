      <h1>Anti-Harassment Protection</h1>
      <p class="anti-harassment-lead">
        We provide legal protection against unlawful recovery practices while offering
        structured support to resolve debt matters calmly, lawfully, and with dignity.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Anti-Harassment Protection?</h2>
      <p>
        Anti-harassment protection focuses on safeguarding individuals from abusive,
        excessive, or unlawful recovery practices by lenders and collection agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        When recovery efforts cross legal or ethical boundaries, professional
        intervention can help restore balance and ensure that your rights are respected.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Help</h2>
      <p>
        We step in to bring structure and accountability to recovery communication,
        ensuring that all actions remain within legal limits.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assessing recovery communications and conduct</li>
        <li>Identifying unlawful or excessive recovery practices</li>
        <li>Engaging with lenders and recovery agents on your behalf</li>
        <li>Establishing lawful communication boundaries</li>
        <li>Supporting parallel resolution or settlement efforts</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Issues We Address</h2>
      <p>
        Harassment can take many forms and often intensifies during periods of financial
        stress. We assist in addressing issues such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Repeated or threatening phone calls</li>
        <li>Inappropriate contact with family or workplace</li>
        <li>Misleading statements or undue pressure</li>
        <li>Violation of legally permitted communication hours</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Our approach is firm, lawful, and measured. We focus on de-escalation while
        ensuring that recovery efforts comply with applicable regulations and standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, we work toward constructive outcomes that support long-term
        financial resolution rather than ongoing conflict.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Professional Support Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Facing aggressive recovery practices alone can be intimidating and emotionally
        draining. Professional representation helps shift the dynamic and introduces
        accountability into the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        With clear boundaries and structured engagement, recovery discussions can move
        from pressure to resolution.
      </p>

      <h2>Taking the Next Step</h2>
      <p>
        You do not have to tolerate unlawful or abusive recovery behavior. Understanding
        your rights is the first step toward regaining peace of mind.
      </p>
